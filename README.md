list of feature requests for ReadCube and Papers

Great work with Papers! I have a few feature requests:

1. like Paperpile, add integrated import button to google scholar pages. Right now it takes 4 clicks to import a PDF from there.
2. add a preference for which browser to use when opening up links from Papers mac app. On my mac I use safari as my default browser, but Papers plug in only works with Chrome.
3. The embedded PDF viewer does not have a history "back" button. This adds cost in jumping to references, because I can not jump back to where I was.
