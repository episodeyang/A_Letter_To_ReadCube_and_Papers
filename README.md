# A Letter To ReadCube and Papers
list of feature requests for ReadCube and Papers

Great work with Papers! I have a few feature requests:

1. like Paperpile, add integrated import button to google scholar pages. Right now it takes 4 clicks to import a PDF from there.
2. add a preference for which browser to use when opening up links from Papers mac app. On my mac I use safari as my default browser, but Papers plug in only works with Chrome.
3. The embedded PDF viewer does not have a history "back" button. This adds cost in jumping to references, because I can not jump back to where I was.
4. <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + A does not work in the search bar. This means I have to delete the line using backspace.
5. Closing the app should not kill all of the PDF tabs
6. in the search page, there is no way to go back to previous search. Would be good to have tags, or a history button.
7. The chrome browser plug-in does not sign-in on the first open. Have to refresh.

The UX needs to go through a full audit. There are many places where it is not smooth.
