# A Letter To ReadCube and Papers
list of feature requests for ReadCube and Papers

Great work with Papers! I have a few feature requests:

1. like Paperpile, add integrated import button to google scholar pages. Right now it takes 4 clicks to import a PDF from there.
2. add a preference for which browser to use when opening up links from Papers mac app. On my mac I use safari as my default browser, but Papers plug in only works with Chrome.
3. The embedded PDF viewer does not have a history "back" button. This adds cost in jumping to references, because I can not jump back to where I was.
4. <kbd>⌘</kbd> + A does not work in the search bar. This means I have to delete the line using backspace.
5. Closing the app should not kill all of the PDF tabs
6. in the search page, there is no way to go back to previous search. Would be good to have tags, or a history button.
7. The chrome browser plug-in does not sign-in on the first open. Have to refresh.
8. Better support for webpages: chrome plug in need to be able to add abtrary web page. Entries need to show webpage preview.
9. The bib file generated is trash. Please allow configuration for the key. It should be something like [lastname][year][first_word_of_title] or something alike. Currently this is just `"undefined"`.
10. As soon as someone has a large number of files, he or she would wnat to be able to search. The current search is non-existent. I expect to be able to search "this raises the question" and get a list of hits on the left, with the PDF view focused on those highlights on the right. People pay $50 for this type of functionalities. I am currently using this app: [PDF Search on AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pdf-search/id1303227688)
11. When exporting the bibliography, make it possible to copy directly from the app. Most of us just need to copy paste into OverLeaf. On mac there isn't a good way to copy the content of a text file so showing the text for copying is way easier.

The UX needs to go through a full audit. There are many places where it is not smooth.
